[The Thoracic Oncology Unit](https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/unidad/tumores-toracicos) is made up of a team of professionals committed to the care of patients with lung cancer and other thoracic tumors. The objective is to achieve a clinical practice of excellence and guarantee the best quality care for patients.

![Logo Clinic]({{site.base.url}}/lab/assets/img/logos/Logotip_clinic.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}


The Unit includes six transversal axes focused on diagnosis, treatment, clinical research, translational research and teaching in lung cancer and other thoracic tumors.

The thirty components of the Unit are structured in fifteen core cores, defined by three main working groups: operational, support and research. The Operational Group is made up of all the members and services that participate daily in the diagnosis and therapeutic decision making and constitute the Thoracic Tumor Committee. The support and research groups include other healthcare professionals associated with the pathology, as well as *basic and translational research groups linked to the University of Barcelona* and the August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS).

### The Society for Translational Medicine 

The [The Society for Translational Medicine](https://www.thestm.org) committee is consisted of the AME Academic Cooperative Group, initiated by a group of world-leading medical specialists and AME Publishing Company (https://www.amegroups.com/who-we-are) with the goal of coordinating the international academic cooperation across different countries.

![Logo TSTM]({{site.base.url}}/lab/assets/img/logos/Logotip_TSTM.jpeg){:height="20%" width="20%"}


After years of development, the AME Academic Cooperative Group (AACG) has grown into a number of subgroups ([AME collaborative groups](https://www.thestm.org/about/internationAdvisoryCommitee)) in various academic and clinical fields and **our group participates in the following groups**: 

- [AME Thoracic Surgery Collaborative Group](https://www.thestm.org/aacg/11)
- [AME Lung Cancer Collaborative Group](https://www.thestm.org/aacg/1)

These subject-based divisions encapsulate a holistic, evidence-driven, and patient-focused approach towards research that is synonymous with the AACG Group. The AACG cooperation includes but not limited to article MDT (aMDT), international MDT(iMDT) and creation of guidelines/consensus. The international research networks and synergistic collaborations solidifies the significance of the AACG Group on the global stage.
