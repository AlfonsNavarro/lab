# Associatons

Copiat, però serveix per agafar la idea

A scientific society is an association of professionals, researchers, specialists or scholars from a branch of knowledge or science in general, which allows them to meet, present the results of their research, confront them with those of their colleagues or specialists in the same domains knowledge, and disseminate their work through specialized publications.

Their activities usually include teaching activities (courses, workshops, seminars, conferences, etc.), research (theoretical or applied) and publications (books, magazines, etc.).

Being a member of a scientific society makes the society strong to represent its associates before the various organisms. Members of TMElab are partners of several national and international scientific societies.

The Gemma Rosell i Romero Students´ Research Award aims to reward students who devote part of their time at university to do biomedical research, even when it may be very difficult to combine with their own studies.

 

It is also our purpose to make this research known among the university community, and especially among the rest of students, giving them the opportunity to discover the scientific world through the presentations their own class mates give.

 

The Prize is the result of the efforts of the Rosell i Romero family, friends and institutions which want to forward the scientific spirit of the young.

 

On this way, we hope humbly to contribute to the advancement of science in our country.

Internationalization is an essential requirement for high-quality research. Collaboration with leading research groups, both national and foreign, offers not only a fruitful exchange of ideas but also synergies in knowledge and experimental capacities. Since its creation, TMElab has been in constant collaboration with worldwide recognized research centers from several countries, both for the development of research projects, for the interchange of students, and the performance of particular assays. In particular, TMELab has been and is member of a good number of international projects, coordinating or forming part of the different Consortia (see below for a sample of such collaborators).

 

We have also a large experience in collaborating with international companies through research projects and contracts (see below).
