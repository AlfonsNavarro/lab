## Long Non-Coding RNAs in Cancer

This book tries to summarize with laboratory protocols, bioinformatic pipelines and review chapters, the main steps performed from translational researchers that from a patient tumor tissue or tumor cells, decides to identify and study tumorigenic lncRNAs. Beginning with the identification (profiling phase) and validation of candidate biomarkers, followed by the decoding of the function developed in the tumor. 

Our group has contributed with chapter 20, which focuses in the analysis of lncRNAs in extracellular vesicles.

## Role of miRNAs in Cancerâ€”Analysis of Their Targetome

MicroRNAs are the best representatives of the non-coding part of the genome
and their functions are mostly linked to their target genes. During the process
of carcinogenesis, both dysregulation of microRNAs and their target genes can
explain the development of the disease. However, most of the target genes of
microRNAs have not yet been elucidated. In this book, we add new information
related to the functions of microRNAs in various tumors and their associated
targetome.

## The Role of ncRNAs in Solid Tumors Prognosis: from Laboratory to Clinical Utility

In this book produced based on the aportations to our Research Topic, we would like to present the recent advances on the roles of ncRNAs on tumorigenesis, metastasis, chemoresistance, radioresistance as well as their potential clinical applications in solid cancers.
